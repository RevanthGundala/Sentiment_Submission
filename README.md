# Sentiment

# Problem
DeFi Protocols's current form of off-chain governance is not entirely ideal. Users must use their own wallet address revealing their identity, which can lead to potential privacy issues in the long run. In addition, the current forms of off-chain governance does not provide much data on who are the types of users voting in terms of how much money they have invested into the specific protocol.

# Solution
Sentiment is an off-chain governance alternative solution that tries to address both of these issues. This project selects groups of users based on how much money they have placed into the protocol. Users' identities are protected via zk proofs, using a Merkle Tree to store all of the users that have been whitelisted and entered into the tree. When these users prove that they are one of the whitelisted memebers, they can post a message from a different account, thereby protecting their identity. Protocols can view these messages and gather data about what the current sentiment is on their protocol and any changes that the communtiy desires based upon different financial groups' needs.
